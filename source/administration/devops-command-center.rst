Overview
^^^^^^^

Incident Response is a Mattermost plugin designed to help organizations monitor, coordinate, and measure their incident response
process so that it can be more transparent and effective.

Workplace messaging is often process-driven rather than completely ad-hoc, and these processes could be organizationally critical in crisis situations. Help
teams collaborate to solve problems that are time-sensitive, recurring, situational.
